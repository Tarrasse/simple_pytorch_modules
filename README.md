# simple_pytorch_modules
implementation of some custom machine learning and deep learning modules and algorithms 

## Notebooks
- Image classifier - CIFAR.ipynb 
- Logistic Regression.ipynb


### 1 - Image classifier - CIFAR.ipynb 
in this notebook i built a convolutional neural network and trained it on CIFAR-10 dataset 

### 2 - Logistic Regression.ipynb
in this notebook i build a custom Logistic regression algorithm with softmax instead of sigmoid activation, using Torch tensors and and torch auto-grade and compared it to sklearn's pre-implemented Logistic regression. 
 - both models got similar results in terms or time complexity and training and test accuracy

**next steps**
- implementing the same algorithm with no auto grade.
- implementing the same algorithm with no auto-grade and custom optimazation algorith. 
- implementing the same algorithm for distuputed preocess.
